This application provides API endpoints for a front-end application 
to access item data for a To Do list. These API endpoints provide support
for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, & Delete) as specified in the
test/test-server.js unit tests. The server.js file is the main entry point 
to the API with middleware support for CORS issues. This file calls to 
the router.js file for the specific API endpoints.
